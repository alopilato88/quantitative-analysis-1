## Overview 

* Difference between a theory and a model
* Explore the different relationship types conveyed by a model
* Build and communicate a path diagram
* Review a published article

## What is a Theory

> A theory is a set of concepts whose proposed relationships offer explanation, understanding, or appreciation of a phenomenon of interest.
> `r tufte::quote_footer("--- Hatch, 2013, p. 5")`

## What is a Model

**Models** are derived from theories to test a particular aspect of that theory. Models are useful because they allow us to communicate and test simplified pieces of our theory, thus providing a more local understanding of our phenomenon.

## Testing Theories with Models and Data

Theories inform the development of models, which go on to inform what data to collect and what hypotheses or propositions we should **empirically test with real data and statistical models**.

The more empirical tests a theory survives, the more confidence we tend to have in that theory.

## Communicating Models with a Path Diagram

Path diagrams are used to visually communicate models and the relationships they posit among variables. 

Path diagrams follow several graphical conventions: 

1. Variables (or phenomena) are represented by a shape usually a square or circle.
2. Causal and predictive relationships among variables are represented with a unidirectional arrow. 
3. Non-causal and non-predictive relationships (i.e. correlations) among variables are represented with curved, non-directional arrows.

## Types of Relationships Among Variables

Here are the three main relationships we will be working with in this course.

## Direct Relationships

A **direct relationship**, causal or otherwise, is a relationship in which a predictor variable (or independent variable) has a direct impact on an outcome variable.

## Moderated Relationships: The "How Strong" Heuristic

A **moderated relationship**, causal or otherwise, involves three variables in which the relationship between two variables, a predictor and outcome variable, changes depending on the value of a third variable, the moderating variable or moderator.

## Thinking About Moderation with Plots

When you are hypothesizing a moderation---also referred to as an interaction---effect, it is helpful to draw a plot of your hypothesized effect.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: false
x <- seq(0, 10, by = .50)
z <- c("Low", "High")
type <- c("none", "strength", "flip")

data <- 
  tidyr::expand_grid(x, z, type) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    y = dplyr::case_when(
      type == "none" & z == "Low" ~ 2 + 2*x,
      type == "none" & z == "High" ~ 4 + 2*x,
      type == "strength" & z == "Low" ~ 5 + .01*x,
      type == "strength" & z == "High" ~ 7 + 2*x,
      z == "Low" ~ 5 - 2*x,
      TRUE ~ 5 + 2*x
    ),
    type_label = dplyr::case_when(
      type == "none" ~ "No Moderation",
      type == "strength" ~ "Strengthening Effect",
      type == "flip" ~ "Reversing Effect"
    ),
    type_label = factor(type_label, 
                        levels = c("No Moderation", "Strengthening Effect", "Reversing Effect"))
  )

ggplot2::ggplot(
  data = data,
  ggplot2::aes(
    x = x,
    y = y,
    lty = z
  )
) + 
  ggplot2::geom_line(
    color = plot_fill,
    lwd = 1.25
  ) + 
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(
    ~ type_label,
    scales = "free"
  ) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Ability",
    y = "Performance",
    lty = "Effort"
  ) +

## Mediated (Indirect) Relationships: The "Why" Heuristic

A **mediated (indirect) relationship** is one where a predictor variable influences an outcome variable **indirectly** through its influence on a mediating variable referred to as a **mediator**.

<br>

![](lecture-imgs/mediated-relationship.png){.width-mediated-image fig-align="center" }

## Thinking About Indirect, Direct, and Total Effects

When we hypothesize a mediated relationship, we can talk about three different effects: 

1. The indirect effect of X on Y
2. The direct effect of X on Y
3. The total effect of X on Y

## Why Use a Path Diagram? 

A path diagram is useful as it is a simple way to graphically communicate our:

1. The phenomena (variables) we are interested in
2. Hypotheses or theoretical propositions about the relationships among variables
3. The regression equations needed to test the hypothesized model 

## The Model Behind Your Homework as an Example

![](lecture-imgs/homework-model.png){fig-align="center"}

## Path Diagrams and Hypotheses 

From the path diagram for our homework, we can infer several different hypotheses/propositions: 

1. The effect of perceived ease of use is partially **mediated** through a tool's perceived usefulness.
2. The effect of perceived ease of use on one's intention to use the tool is **moderated** by one's previous experience with a similar tool.
3. The effect of perceived usefulness on one's intention to use the tool is **moderated** by one's previous experience with a similar tool.

## Path Diagrams and Regression Equations

We can also infer the regression equations needed to test our hypotheses from the path diagram: 

$$X_{\text{Useful.}}=\beta_0 + \beta_1X_{\text{Ease Use}}+\epsilon$$
$$Y_{\text{Beh. Int.}}=\beta_0+\beta_1X_{\text{Ease Use}}+\beta_2X_{\text{Useful.}}+\beta_3Z_{\text{Mod.}}+\epsilon$$

## Using Theories to Build Models

Giessner et al. (2023) use two broad theories to build their more narrow model: 

* Organizational support theory
* Conservation of resources theory

## Mediation Hypotheses: H1 to H3 

* *H1*: Merging organizations will experience greater decreases in job satisfaction relative to nonmerging organizations within the same context and time period. **[Total Effect]**
* *H2*: Merging organizations will experience greater increases in absenteeism relative to nonmerging organizations within the same context and time period. **[Direct Effect]**
* *H3*: The increases in absenteeism for merging organizations will be **(partially) mediated** by decreases in job satisfaction. **[Indirect Effect]**

## Moderation Hypothesis: H4

* *H4*: The decreases in job satisfaction for merged versus nonmerged organizations will be **moderated** by changes in supportive leadership at the midlevel management level, such that **this relationship will be weaker for organizations with increasing levels of supportive leadership**.

## Moderated Mediation Hypothesis: H5

* *H5*: The increases in absenteeism for merging organizations relative to nonmerging organizations as **mediated by the decreases in job satisfaction** will be **moderated by changes in supportive leadership** at the midlevel management level, such that **the indirect effect of mergers on absenteeism via job satisfaction will be weaker when there is an increase in supportive leadership**.
